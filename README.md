## `requirements`

To go through this course, you will need to have a few things installed ahead of time.

- [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - :black_square_button: If you are on Windows then download it from the website. (You could also use something like Chocolatey if you are in to that.)
  - :apple: If you are on MacOS I highly recommend using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and running `brew install node`
  - :penguin: If you are on linux just install from your package manager
    - :small_red_triangle: Arch: `pacman -S nodejs npm`
    - :red_circle: Ubuntu: `apt install -y nodejs`
    - :fish: Gentoo: Lol you don't need my help (`emerge nodejs`)
- **OPTIONAL:** [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

  - I just prefer `yarn` to `npm` for package management, but it isn't required. Any `yarn` commands used in this documentation can be replaced with their `npm` equivalents.

- [VueCLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
  - This is the tool we will use to generate all of the boilerplate for our Vue projects

## `$ wtf vue`

```sh
$ wtf vue
VUE: a progressive framework for building user interfaces
```

Essentially, it is a really popular javascript framework for building UIs and frontend apps.
